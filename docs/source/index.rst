What this is
=============================================================================================
This is my **personal knowledge index**.

I use it to:

- remind myself what topics matter
- capture the **key takeaways** I trust (or mostly trust)
- keep **curated links** for deeper dives
- leave breadcrumbs for things I want to explore later

It's written primarily for **future me**, and secondarily for friends who might find the material useful for learning or interview prep.

Think of this as a **map and memory aid**, not a full course.
=============================================================================================
What this is not
=============================================================================================
- Not a journal or workspace for raw thinking
- Not a dumping ground for half-baked notes or chat transcripts
- Not a textbook (details and derivations live elsewhere)
- Not a polished portfolio or blog

=============================================================================================
How to read this
=============================================================================================
Each topic is intentionally lightweight:

- a short scope
- a few stable takeaways
- links I consider worth revisiting
- pointers to explore further

Some sections will be deeper than others. That's expected.

=============================================================================================
How to use this
=============================================================================================
If you want:

- a quick refresh: scan the takeaways
- a path to go deeper: follow the links
- a polished exposition: this is not the place

This document is meant to stay **useful, skimmable, and low-maintenance** over time.
